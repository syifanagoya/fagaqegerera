Then he got the backing of then-mayor Andrew Young, as well as private support and sponsors. The IOC chose Atlanta to host the 1996 Olympics, much to his surprise. Even after winning the bid, he remained the chairman of the Atlanta Olympic Committee.</p><p>Payne was named chairman of Augusta National Golf Club, home of the Master’s Tournament, on May 5, 2006, succeeding Hootie Johnson. Payne began working for the club at the start of the season in October of the same year.</p><p>Payne criticized Tiger Woods before that year’s Masters on April 7, 2010, claiming that he had failed as a role model.</p><p>The following year, Payne and his fellow Augusta National members implemented another modern change to their featured golf tournament. They also authorized the video game “Tiger Woods PGA Tour 12,” which was designed to inspire future generations of golfers. The proceeds from the video game’s sales would go to a non-profit foundation that promotes young golfers.</p><p>On August 23, 2017, Augusta National announced that Payne would step down as chairman of the club effective October 16, 2017, and would be succeeded by Fred Ridley.</p><p>He began his career as the chairman of Centennial Holding Company, based in Atlanta.

In addition, he was elected as a Georgia Trustee in 2014. He was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in the lifetime achievement category in the class of 2019.</p><p>Aside from that, one of his greatest achievements was persuading members of the International Olympic Committee to hold the Olympics in Atlanta, a dream that was realized in 1996. He also pushed for the first women to be admitted to the club’s membership, which had never been done before.</p><h2>Bill Payne’s Net Worth in 2023</h2><p><strong>Bill Payne</strong> fortune stems primarily from his position as chairman of Augusta National Golf Club.
