I prefer the latter.</p><p id=ep2WBfBNioYb data-wc=31>According to my research, upon waking at 2.30 am, Mark prays for 30 minutes until 3:15 am&nbsp;and after that, it's time for breakfast, ready for a 3:40 am&nbsp;workout start.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c9b15b613887-mark-wahlberg-gym-ludacris-z.jpg><p id=e6MA0wRG9ojw data-wc=7><strong>Mark Wahlberg in the gym with Ludacris</strong></p><p id=ehJSsVk2TE9E data-wc=29>On his Instagram, Mark has previously shared his routine.

So, swings and roundabouts. I'm all for an early bedtime so this bit sounds right up my street.</p><h3>But WHY the early workout?</h3><p id=eo_DZ8dhyYGh data-wc=54>Speaking in the past to Men's Health, Mark said that if he gets it done early, he can go to the golf course at 6.30 am and be done by 8.30 am and "then be home and then do the rest of my stuff: work with a physiotherapist, get treatment, hit the cryo chamber."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9eac507905a1-mark-wahlberg-golf-z.jpg><p id=e_2MAQ0daf-K data-wc=4><strong>Mark Wahlberg enjoys golf</strong></p><p id=etEf8xbcIM0C data-wc=55>He also said, being the continuously inspiring guy he is: "The only way to be the best is to keep working like you got nothing.

Either way, it's two workouts a day for me for the next seven days…</p><h2>Mark Wahlberg's workout schedule</h2><p id=e7zL_QVSL0Yq data-wc=19>I scoured the world wide web to gather together a collection of Mark’s workouts (see below for a selection).</p><p id=eWs27hjYkYjq data-wc=79>When Mark was training for his role in 2013's Pain & Gain, he needed to pack on over 15kg of muscle in just eight weeks. A hard feat for anyone. Luckily, Mark had the assistance of Brian Nguyen, his personal trainer since 2006. Speaking to Coach magazine, Brian said that the aim was to train like a bodybuilder, doing isolation exercises -where one specific muscle group is trained at a time - was the key player in Mark's workouts.</p><p id=epyk03ipD9nU data-wc=37>Brian also said: "He did a lot of basic functional movements – kettlebell work with squats, lunges, inverted rows on the TRX – and then I started getting him into single-leg and single-arm stuff, creating more rotation."&nbsp;</p><p id=em-K_zxRV0oV data-wc=38>Bryan has also said that Mark did a lot of loaded carries. I personally love these. They involve walking a certain distance carrying a weight, such as a kettlebell in each hand, or a sandbag across the back.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4674512b4fb2-mark-wahlhbeg-abs-z.jpg><p id=eKebpHCcy8iq data-wc=7><strong>Mark Wahlberg shows off his beach body</strong></p><p id=eH8KmwxALhOZ data-wc=41>Mark has revealed that he was training five days a week, which for me, is perfectly doable as I tend to train five to six days a week already. Although I'm not exactly sure mine and Mark’s workouts are on par.</p><p id=evRkrb_0IbtB data-wc=21>Alongside this, whilst attempting to bulk up big time, in just two months Mark was supposedly eating 10 MEALS A DAY.</p><p id=eJi1fM8lsdrH data-wc=7>However, Mark doesn't just hit the gym.</p><p id=eWgPDveF61RQ data-wc=21>He's also been known to attend F45 classes, a popular functional fitness class located in hundreds of destinations around the world.</p><p id=eZim_mlE03U2 data-wc=5><strong>Mark Wahlberg loves F45 workouts</strong></p><p id=eM94g3H8F4Zd data-wc=39>He also prioritises recovery.

By the end, I was drenched in sweat but much like Mark revealed, I was free of frustrations!&nbsp;</p><h2>What did I learn from training like Mark for one week?</h2><p id=e6QLLtWkd5lt9 data-wc=54>I felt stronger.&nbsp;No word of a lie, the intensity of the weight lifting sessions has left me feeling like a champion, and my upper body is grateful for the work I’ve put into it.

In the past, he’s been placed on&nbsp;7,000 calorie diets (consisting of bucket loads of rice, 12 eggs, meat, healthy carbs, all spread out over eight meals) to gain weight fast for film roles, however, from my research, Mark's day-to-day consists of six well-balanced meals, curated by his personal chef.

After this week of workouts, I was ravenous, and could easily have eaten six meals a day.
