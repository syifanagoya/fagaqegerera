Her parents had moved to the United States from China in the 1940s. Her mother worked as a translator for the United Nations and her father was the owner of a medicine company after having graduated from Yanjing University in China and MIT in the United States. She has one younger brother named Kenneth.</p><p>At the age of 8, Wang began figure skating and soon was training at a high-level. She skated both independently and in pairs and competed at the 1968 U.S. Figure Skating Championships with the goal of making the U.S. Olympic team. While she ultimately was unable to do so, she continues skating today and has designed many figure skating costumes.</p><p>Wang attended Friends Seminary for the beginning of her education and then transferred to the Chapin School, an all-girls academy, from where she graduated from high school in 1967. She then enrolled at Sarah Lawrence College where she pursued a degree in art history. During this time, she studied abroad at the University of Paris and then graduated with her bachelor's degree in 1971.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Immediately upon graduating from college, Wang was hired to be an editor at "Vogue," making her the youngest editor in the history of the magazine.

Since then, she has expanded her boutiques to cities like London, Tokyo, and Sydney.</p><p>In 2002, she expanded beyond wedding dresses and began to produce designs for the home, launching The Vera Wang China and Crystal Collection. She also launched a retail line called Simply Vera in collaboration with the retail store, Kohl's, in 2007 in an effort to make her designs more available to the general public at affordable prices. She followed a similar trajectory with her wedding designs, partnering with David's Bridal in 2011 to launch "White by Vera Wang," which offers wedding and bridesmaids gowns beginning at only $600. She also worked with Men's Wearhouse to offer two tuxedo styles.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-179181 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/Vera-Wang.jpg alt="Vera Wang Net Worth" width=594 height=395 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-179181 class=wp-caption-text>Frazer Harrison/Getty Images</p><p>As Wang made a name for herself as a prominent wedding dress designer, she began to receive requests for many high profile figures commissioning custom gowns for their big day.
